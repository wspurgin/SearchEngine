USER MANUAL

This is the User Manual for the MustangWiki Search Engine. Below are the commands and their descriptions separated by modes given in the user interface.

“Interactive” mode

- search [query statement]
This command is used to search the index with the given query statement. A list of 15 documents will be returned from which the user can peruse. (In stress-test mode, the list will be printed to screen but that is all.)
Example: “search AND Boston Seattle” will return a list of documents containing Boston and Seattle.

- build-as-avl
Rebuild/build the index with an AVL structure. (if the index is already built with an AVL structure, this will still rebuild the index).

- build-as-ht
Rebuild/build the index with a HashTable structure. (HashTable structure is the default structure of the Index, and like the AVL tree, it will rebuild the index as a HashTable regardless of whether it is already built as with a HashTable structure).

“Maintenance” mode

- add [file path]
Given that the file indicated is a file with valid xml (proper structure) then the contents of that document will be added to the Index.

- clear-index
Will wipe the index clean.

“Stress-test” mode

All the commands above can be used in the “stress-test” mode. Upon entering the stress-test mode, you will be prompted to enter a file path as such:
“Enter path to stress-test file:
>[path to file]”

Note: the format for each line of the stress-test file should be:
“:[command] [command-args]”

Global commands

- quit
Exits the application.

- help
Displays this help text.

-ch-mode
Will change the current mode to either 'interactive', 'maintenance', or 'stress-test'

Note: Regardless of what mode you are in, if you prefix any command with ':' and it will override your mode permissions.
